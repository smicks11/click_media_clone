<p>The importance of website for business growth is unquestionable. </p>



<p>Websites have become the staple for businesses to promote their services, engage with customers and drive sales.</p>



<p>Having a website can greatly drive sales and impact your bottom line as a business.</p>



<p>Also, websites have become more sophisticated with time, having the ability to engage better with customers using various forms of media (video, audio, images, text etc) to communicate more efficiently.</p>



<p>Businesses that understand why a website is important are constantly using technology to complement their sales and marketing teams.</p>



<p>This enables them have more time to focus on providing quality services while saving cost.</p>



<p>There are so many reasons why a website is important for your business but i&#8217;ll be focusing only the important ones.</p>



<p>So let&#8217;s get cracking!</p>



<h2>1. Information Resource</h2>



<p>A website serves as an online digital brochure for your business, conveying your services and products to the world.</p>



<p>Think for a second how this can impact your business.</p>



<p>Customers get to see your products and services without giving you a call.</p>



<p>Guiding the customer through your services and helping them take immediate decisions.</p>



<p>The amount of information you can have on a single website is limitless.</p>



<p>You can have as many information as you want but <g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_tiny gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="4" data-gr-id="4">i</g> highly recommend answering the following questions in detail as a starting point;</p>



<ul><li>Who you are</li><li>What you do</li><li>Contact Information</li></ul>



<h2>2. Lead Generation</h2>



<p>Lead generation is very important for business growth and the most cost effective way to generate leads is through your website.</p>



<p>Whether you want people to sign up for your monthly newsletter, fill out a contact form, RSVP for a seminar or request a callback, your website can help you achieve this and much more in a seamless and <g class="gr_ gr_115 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="115" data-gr-id="115">cost effective</g> way.</p>



<p>There are several ways to implement a lead generation strategy that is specific to your business goals but without a website, you could just as well be throwing money away.</p>



<p>Lead generation with a proper digital marketing strategy can propel your business to another level</p>



<h2>3. Digital Marketing</h2>



<p>Promoting your business through online and offline media without a website is money wasted.</p>



<p>People need a place where they can find more information about your business and as you already know, your website is a great information resource tool.</p>



<p>So whether you plan to <a href="http://clickmedia.com.ng/online-marketing-guide-for-beginners/">promote your business on Social Media</a> or print promotional flyers, be sure to have a website that clearly describes your business in detail.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with online marketing or what it can do for your business, please checkout our guide on <a href="http://clickmedia.com.ng/online-marketing-guide-for-beginners/">how to do online marketing&nbsp;for&nbsp;small&nbsp;business.</a></p>



<h2>4. Brand Trust and Loyalty</h2>



<p>Having a website can help build brand trust and loyalty with your customers. </p>



<p>People start to see you as a serious business and that alone helps them trust  your brand.</p>



<p>A professionally designed website with relevant content that answers your customer questions is an invaluable tool.</p>



<p>So whether you are a small business owner or an individual who offers a particular service, having a website helps build a relationship based on trust with your customers.</p>



<h2>5. Google Search (SEO)</h2>



<p>With over 3.5 billion daily searches on Google alone, the chances of people finding your business on Google is zero if you don&#8217;t have a website.</p>



<p>More people are turning to Google search to find information and services of interest on a daily basis. Just take a look at the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="live statistics here (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.internetlivestats.com/google-search-statistics/" target="_blank">live search statistics here.</a></p>



<p>The only way to get onboard is by having your own website and letting Google find you so other people can find you as well.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve seen people say <strong><em>&#8220;Oh, i don&#8217;t need a website, i have an Instagram page to promote my business&#8221;</em></strong>. </p>



<p>Well, your customers won&#8217;t go to Instagram to search for you, they will most likely go to Google.</p>



<p>So if you want people to find your business online through Google, hire a web designer today.</p>



<h2>6. Cost-effective sales team</h2>



<p>How many sales people do you need to hit your bottom line on a daily, monthly and yearly basis?</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t answer that for you but i can only imagine it&#8217;s a lot.</p>



<p>A website doubles as a salesperson and secretary, providing helpful information about your business and services.</p>



<p>By utilising basic online marketing strategies to drive traffic to your website, you can convert more visitors to customers using the sales person and secretary approach.</p>



<p>A well designed website can save you the cost in hiring more salespeople to help drive your bottom line.</p>



<h2>7. 24/7 Customer Support and Engagement</h2>



<p>A website gives your business round the clock visibility and ability to engage with customers while you sleep.</p>



<p>This can greatly impact your business.</p>



<p>Customers can fill out your contact form to request your services, grab your phone number, lodge a complaint and find answers to their question round the clock.</p>



<p>This is one area where your website truly outshines your customer support team.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s an inexpensive way to constantly engage with your customers without the need to be physically present.</p>



<p>Anyone looking for more information about your business simply goes to your website and voila! <strong><em>Problem solved!</em></strong></p>



<h2>8. Operational Cost Management</h2>



<p>Having a website can greatly reduce the cost of running your business by delegating customer support and sales services to the website.</p>



<p>Also, promoting your business online through social media and other forms of online marketing is a huge cost saver when compared to the conventional types of advertising like billboards, TV commercials and much more.</p>



<p>Your website works round the clock, no holidays, no call-in-sick moments, no gimmicks. It simply works and helps your customers answer relevant questions.</p>



<h2>9. Efficient Business Operations</h2>



<p>A well designed website can help you run your business operations more efficiently.</p>



<p>As the most relevant informations are already on your website, customers would have had their minds halfway made up before contacting you.</p>



<p>So rather than spending more time on the phone pitching your services, you instead, help your customers make the right decisions to land a sale when they contact you.</p>



<h2>10. Increase Business Visibility, Awareness and Reach</h2>



<p>Having your own website can greatly increase your business awareness, visibility and reach. </p>



<p>By developing a good content and marketing strategy on a well-designed search engine optimized website, people searching for your services can easily find you thereby increasing your reach.</p>



<p>We can all agree that more visibility and reach equals more opportunity to land a sale.</p>



<p></p>



<p>To conclude, the benefits of having a website for your business far outweighs what has been mentioned here.</p>



<p>If you read this article all the way and you&#8217;re still struggling to understand why your business needs a website, let me quickly list out the take-home points.</p>



<h3>A good website will help your business;</h3>



<ul><li>Become more efficient</li><li>Build customer trust and loyalty</li><li>Increase sales</li><li>Increase awareness and reach</li><li>Generate new leads</li><li>And finally, help more people find your business through Google search.</li></ul>

<p>I&#8217;d be glad to help out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To really understand the benefits of Instagram advertising for your business in 2019, let me share some stats with you.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/instagram-business-account-advertising-2.jpg" alt="Instagram advertising" class="wp-image-236" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/instagram-business-account-advertising-2.jpg 1024w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/instagram-business-account-advertising-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/instagram-business-account-advertising-2-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Growing your business through Instagram advertising</figcaption></figure>



<p>Instagram is a photo and video sharing application launched in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. It was later bought by Facebook in 2012 for $1 billion.</p>



<p>Instagram reached 1 million users in it first two <g class="gr_ gr_4 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="4" data-gr-id="4">month</g> of <g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="5" data-gr-id="5">release,</g> and has grown to 1 billion active monthly users as at June 2018. </p>



<p>Just take a look at the graph below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="664" src="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Instagram-active-monthly-users-2018-1024x664.jpg" alt="Instagram active monthly users" class="wp-image-244" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Instagram-active-monthly-users-2018-1024x664.jpg 1024w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Instagram-active-monthly-users-2018-300x195.jpg 300w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Instagram-active-monthly-users-2018-768x498.jpg 768w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Instagram-active-monthly-users-2018.jpg 1418w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Number of monthly active Instagram users from January 2013 to June 2018 (in millions)</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>According to Statistic Brain Research Institute, 52 million photos are posted daily and about 35 billion photos so far have been posted on Instagram since its release.</p>



<p>The biggest age group of active Instagram users is 18-29 years and this account for 59% of the total users while the smallest user group at 8% are 65 years and older.</p>



<p>In summary, 1 billion people use Instagram actively on a daily basis and business are generating more revenue using Instagram advertising to promote their services.</p>



<p>If you want a comprehensive analysis on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Instagram revenue and usage (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.businessofapps.com/data/instagram-statistics/" target="_blank">Instagram revenue and usage</a>, check out this nice article by Artyom Dogtiev.</p>



<p>But first, let&#8217;s take a look at how Instagram advertising revenue has grown over the past 3 years just to give you an idea of how successful the platform has become and why brands are relying on Instagram to engage with their customers.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1418" height="928" src="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/instagram-revenue-graph-statista.jpg" alt="Advertising revenue of Instagram from 2015 to 2018" class="wp-image-217" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/instagram-revenue-graph-statista.jpg 1418w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/instagram-revenue-graph-statista-300x196.jpg 300w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/instagram-revenue-graph-statista-1024x670.jpg 1024w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/instagram-revenue-graph-statista-768x503.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1418px) 100vw, 1418px" /><figcaption>Advertising revenue of Instagram from 2015 to 2018 (in billion U.S. dollars) by Statista</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>But not every business can benefit from this. I&#8217;d tell you why later but first, let&#8217;s look at how you would set up your Instagram business account.</p>



<h3>How to set up Instagram Business account</h3>



<p>If you are going to use Instagram for your business, It is important to sign up using an email address that is different from your personal email.</p>



<p>This is very crucial as you won&#8217;t want to mix your business content with personal selfies.</p>



<p>It wouldn&#8217;t look good for your brand, trust me.</p>



<p>Marketing is all about the audience and not you, so stay focused on pushing your brand with a separate Instagram account.</p>



<p>Instagram gives you the option of setting up a business account when you sign up. Take a look at the image below.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="802" src="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/instagram-business-profile-setup.jpg" alt="Switching to Instagram business account" class="wp-image-231" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/instagram-business-profile-setup.jpg 1024w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/instagram-business-profile-setup-300x235.jpg 300w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/instagram-business-profile-setup-768x602.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption>Switching to Instagram business account</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This can be very helpful as it shows you some analytics of how your posts are performing.</p>



<p>It helps you better understand how people are engaging with your posts, their age group, gender, likes and much more.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="802" src="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/instagram-business-post-analytics.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-233" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/instagram-business-post-analytics.jpg 1024w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/instagram-business-post-analytics-300x235.jpg 300w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/instagram-business-post-analytics-768x602.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>Understanding how these metrics work can help you tailor your post properly to reach the right audience.</p>



<h3>How to optimize your Instagram profile for business</h3>



<p>Setting up your Instagram profile for business is a very important step that shouldn&#8217;t be taken lightly.</p>



<h4>Choosing the right username</h4>



<p>While choosing your username, be sure to use your business name.</p>



<p>If your business name has been taken by someone else, try adding a couple of characters or digits but keep it as close to your business name as possible.</p>



<h4>Profile picture</h4>



<p>Most businesses on Instagram use their logo as <g class="gr_ gr_7 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" id="7" data-gr-id="7">profile</g> picture, although there is no standard as to what is preferred but, this is a very common practice.</p>



<p>Using your logo help you stand out as a brand or business, but first, ensure your logo is optimised for social media.</p>



<p>If your logo looks too big when you set it up, it&#8217;s time to hire a designer to optimise it for social media.</p>



<h4>Instagram bio</h4>



<p>Instagram only allows for a maximum of 150 characters so keep it short and concise.</p>



<p>Try to add a little bit of personality and flare without losing focus of your core services.</p>



<h4>Website link</h4>



<p>Instagram gives you the option to add your website link. This could also be a link to your blog or other social media profiles.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/instagram-business-website-link-2-1024x802.jpg" alt="Instagram website link" class="wp-image-234"/><figcaption>Instagram website link</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>This is the only place where links are clickable so be sure to change it when you share a post that requires an action<g class="gr_ gr_20 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style replaceWithoutSep" id="20" data-gr-id="20">.</g></p>



<p>Ensure your links are short. You can use services like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="bit.ly (opens in a new tab)" href="https://bit.ly.com" target="_blank">bit.ly</a> to shorten your link.</p>

<p>Promoting your interior decoration work on Instagram is a nice way to get new businesses.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<h2>10. Video Production and Animation</h2>



<p>This made it to the bottom of the list and you want to know why, Instagram only allows 60 second videos.</p>



<p>While this might seem challenging, you still have 60 seconds to showcase your work and tell a story.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

<p>If you can&#8217;t create an interesting video that will get people talking, don&#8217;t advertise until you do.</p>



<p>Just be creative and explore diverse storylines to capture as much audience as possible.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p>Not all businesses made it on the list and that for a good reason.</p>



<p>Instagram is a great place to advertise and engage with people but it doesn&#8217;t seem to fit quite well with all businesses.</p>



<p>This is because Instagram is a visual platform with a young audience mostly focused on lifestyle.</p>



<p>So if you are a lawyer or tax attorney looking for a big break on Instagram, I&#8217;m so sorry. But hey, you can always try <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="LinkedIn advertising (opens in a new tab)" href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/ads" target="_blank">LinkedIn advertising</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So you want to learn how to become an online marketing guru? We are here to help.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/online-marketing.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-201" width="1280" height="836" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/online-marketing.jpeg 1280w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/online-marketing-300x196.jpeg 300w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/online-marketing-1024x669.jpeg 1024w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/online-marketing-768x502.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><figcaption>Online Marketing &#8211; Photo by Studio 7042 from Pexels</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Online marketing has proven to be an effective way to sell products, services or promote your brand online.</p>



<p>If you are reading this right now, It means you are connected to the internet obviously.</p>



<p>Therefore, do you know how many people use the internet on a daily basis?</p>



<p>According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="internetworldstats.com internet usage statistics (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm" target="_blank">internetworldstats.com internet usage statistics</a> of July 2018,  about 4.2bn people out of an estimated world population of 7.6bn have access to the internet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/world-internet-usage-2018.jpg" alt="World Internet Usage Statistics" class="wp-image-203" width="1151" height="423" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/world-internet-usage-2018.jpg 1534w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/world-internet-usage-2018-300x110.jpg 300w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/world-internet-usage-2018-1024x376.jpg 1024w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/world-internet-usage-2018-768x282.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1151px) 100vw, 1151px" /><figcaption>World Internet Usage Statistics</figcaption></figure>



<p>And increasing yearly at a rate of 51%.</p>



<p>So what has that got to do with online marking? Well, quite a lot.</p>



<p>As more people spend time accessing the internet, it&#8217;s a lot more profitable to reach out to them online.</p>



<p>Imagine you had to sell a product or service to 500 people in 1 month by knocking on doors.</p>



<p>What are the chances that you will be able to talk to 25 people in a day for 20 working days in a month?</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sad-young-man.jpeg" alt="Photo by Segopotso Makhutja from Pexels" class="wp-image-202" width="960" height="640" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sad-young-man.jpeg 1280w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sad-young-man-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sad-young-man-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/sad-young-man-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><figcaption>Photo by Segopotso Makhutja from Pexels</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Even I couldn&#8217;t do that.</p>



<p>Now imagine reaching out to 4.2bn people from your laptop or phone, sounds interesting right.</p>



<p>This is why both small and big businesses take advantage of online marketing to grow their business.</p>



<h3>So what is Online marketing?</h3>



<p>According to Wikipedia, &#8220;<em>online marketing is a form of marketing and advertising which uses the internet to deliver promotional marketing messages to consumers.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>In other words, online marketing is a way to promote your goods and services on the internet.</p>



<p>My question to you is, if people are spending so much time on the internet, <strong>what are they doing?</strong></p>



<p>Let us try to outline a few of our activities so we can better understand how people use the internet.</p>



<p>People use the internet to;</p>



<ul><li>Read news and follow the latest happenings</li><li>Chat with friends on social media like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat</li><li>Check and respond to emails</li><li>Search for things of interest on Google</li><li>Watch videos on YouTube or Vimeo</li><li>Play online games</li></ul>



<p><em>And much more.</em></p>



<p>All these activities provide an avenue to sell your products and services to the billions of people using them.</p>



<p>Understanding <strong><em>who they are</em></strong>, <strong><em>where they spend most of their time</em></strong> and <strong><em>what you&#8217;re going to say to them</em></strong> is the key to becoming a successful online marketing guru.</p>



<h3>Why strive to understand online marketing?</h3>



<p>Businesses have become reliant on online platforms to convey their messages to consumers.</p>



<p>This reliance on online marketing has given rise to a new breed of experts, known as online marketers.</p>



<p>Online marketers understand how people use the internet and therefore, apply targeted online marketing strategies to help businesses grow.</p>



<p>Businesses pay a lot of money to hire the best online marketers because they get the best results.</p>



<h3>What types of online marketing are available.</h3>



<p>Online marketing can take various forms depending on what the business goals or marketing objectives are.</p>



<p>Your choice of a single online marketing platform or a combination of them depends greatly on the objective of the business.</p>



<p>Below are the most common ones;</p>



<ul><li>Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</li><li>Social Media Marketing (SMM)</li><li>Content Marketing</li><li>Email Marketing</li><li>Pay-Per-Click Advertising</li><li>Affiliate Marketing</li></ul>



<p>It can be hard deciding on which is best to use but understanding where each of them are effective can help you decide quickly.</p>



<p>In this article, I will be providing a detailed explanation on only four of them and their use cases.</p>



<p>These four include Search Engine Marketing, Social Media Marketing, Content Marketing and Email Marketing.</p>



<p>But before we start discussing what they are and how they work, it is important to understand two frequently used buzzwords in online advertising.</p>



<p>These are Cost Per Click (CPC) and Cost Per Impression (CPI).</p>



<h4>Cost Per Click (CPC)</h4>



<p>Cost Per Click or CPC as it is commonly referred to is the cost incurred when a person clicks on your advertisement.</p>



<p>These can range from a few cents to a couple of dollars based on the keyword or the type of advertisement.</p>



<p>Although you can specify how much you are willing to pay per click, most online marketing providers will suggest competitive range for you.</p>



<h4>Cost Per Impression (CPI)</h4>



<p>This refers to the cost incured when your advertisement is shown a thousand times.</p>



<p>Also referred to as Cost per thousand impressions.</p>



<p>These can also range from a few cents to a couple of dollars based on the keyword or the type of advertisement.</p>



<p>Now that you understand what CPC and CPI means, let&#8217;s move on.</p>



<h3>Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</h3>



<p>With <a href="https://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-marketing/search-engine-statistics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Google search alone averaging 3.5bn daily as at 2018 (opens in a new tab)">Google search alone averaging 3.5bn daily as at 2018</a>, we cannot overemphasize the importance of search engine marketing.</p>



<p>SEM involves identifying and promoting keywords that people can use to find your business or service online.</p>



<p>The term Keyword refers to what people type in a search box when they are looking for your business.</p>



<p>Luckily, there are several free Keyword research tools you can use to identify phrases people use to search for businesses related to yours.</p>



<p>So how do you know when to deploy search engine marketing? Let&#8217;s look at an example.</p>



<h4>When to use Search Engine Marketing (SEM)</h4>



<p>Let&#8217;s assume you were contacted by a construction company, for simplicity, let&#8217;s call the company XYZ Constructions.</p>



<p>XYZ Constructions just unveiled their new website and they want to drive traffic to the site.</p>



<p>They are excited about the variety of construction services they offer and they want the world to know.</p>



<p>This is a good use case for search engine marketing.</p>



<p>Since most of the people looking for construction companies in their locality will most likely go to Google and search, you can target relevant keywords to drive traffic to their website.</p>



<p>Here is an example using <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ubersuggest (opens in a new tab)" href="https://app.neilpatel.com/en/ubersuggest/keyword_ideas?keyword=construction&amp;country=us" target="_blank">ubersuggest</a> for keyword research.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ubersuggest-construction-keyword.jpg" alt="Construction Keyword research on ubersuggest " class="wp-image-204" width="1242" height="915" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ubersuggest-construction-keyword.jpg 1656w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ubersuggest-construction-keyword-300x221.jpg 300w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ubersuggest-construction-keyword-1024x754.jpg 1024w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ubersuggest-construction-keyword-768x566.jpg 768w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ubersuggest-construction-keyword-1536x1132.jpg 1536w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ubersuggest-construction-keyword-1568x1155.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px" /><figcaption>Construction Keyword research on ubersuggest </figcaption></figure>



<p>My advice is to start with a broad keyword such as &#8220;construction&#8221; and then narrow it down to be more specific based on how people are searching.</p>



<p>Using long tail keywords will not only help you drive meaningful traffic but also reduce your Cost Per Click.</p>



<h3>Social Media Marketing (SMM)</h3>



<p>Many businesses are benefitting from social media marketing so understanding how it works is very important.</p>



<p>Social media is a great way for businesses to engage with their customers.</p>



<p>As a result, more businesses are spending money to advertise and grow their social media profiles to foster customer interaction.</p>



<p>With Facebook having the lion share in social media advertising, it&#8217;s no surprise that a lot of businesses focus on Facebook and <a href="https://clickmedia.com.ng/10-small-businesses-for-instagram-advertising-in-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Instagram advertising (opens in a new tab)">Instagram advertising</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/social-media-advertising-statistics-by-statista.com_.jpg" alt="Advertising revenues of selected social networks" class="wp-image-198" width="1097" height="686" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/social-media-advertising-statistics-by-statista.com_.jpg 1462w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/social-media-advertising-statistics-by-statista.com_-300x188.jpg 300w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/social-media-advertising-statistics-by-statista.com_-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/social-media-advertising-statistics-by-statista.com_-768x480.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1097px) 100vw, 1097px" /><figcaption>Advertising revenues of selected social networks in the United States from 2015 to 2018 (in million U.S. dollars)</figcaption></figure>



<p>But how do you know which one works best for what you are trying to sell.</p>



<p>These comes down to a couple of things;</p>



<ol><li>The type of content you are promoting.</li><li>The type of audience you want to sell to.</li></ol>



<p>Some content fare better than others on different social media platforms.</p>



<p>For example, a short and exciting text to get people talking will do well on Twitter as compared with Facebook or LinkedIn.</p>



<p>Whereas a video content will do very well across board.</p>



<p>Pictures on the other hand do exceedingly well on Instagram.</p>



<p>So be sure to understand your target audience and the type of content you are putting out to maximise your advertising budget.</p>



<p>Social media marketing is great for</p>



<ul><li>Growing a business social media profile to foster interaction and increase social proof.</li><li>Drive traffic to a website.</li><li>Drive traffic to a social media post.</li><li>Getting people engaged on your content.</li></ul>



<p>These and much more explains why social media marketing is very effective.</p>



<h4>Let&#8217;s look at a simple use case.</h4>



<p>Going back to our XYZ Construction company example. </p>



<p>Imagine they start a blog where they talk about challenges in the construction business in Lagos Nigeria and how to overcome them.</p>



<p>Where do you think is best to promote such content? <em>This is a small dive into content marketing.</em></p>



<p>Let me give you a second to decide&#8230;</p>



<p>First and foremost, as always, I&#8217;d inquire from the company what their objectives are.</p>



<p>Doing so will help me decide on the best platform to use.</p>



<p>If their objective is to position themselves as an industry leader in the construction industry, I&#8217;d opt in for LinkedIn advertising.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if they just want to educate people and drive traffic to their blog, I&#8217;d opt in for Facebook advertising.</p>



<p><em><strong>So how did i come up with that you might ask? </strong></em></p>



<p>Let&#8217;s understand what each of the popular social media networks are great for.</p>



<div class="schema-faq wp-block-yoast-faq-block"><div class="schema-faq-section"><strong class="schema-faq-question">1 &#8211; Facebook</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Great for connecting with family and friends. Drives engagement based on our human nature of socialising.</p> </div> <div class="schema-faq-section"><strong class="schema-faq-question">2 &#8211; Twitter</strong> <p class="schema-faq-answer">Great for communicating short and exciting update.

<p>Deciding on which to use at anytime depends on the theme of the content and audience.</p>

<h3>Content Marketing</h3>

<p>Ever heard the phrase<em> &#8220;Content in King&#8221;</em>? I&#8217;m sure you have.</p>



<p>If you want to rank higher in search results then you should be writing content.</p>



<p>Now, content marketing is the art of driving traffic and user engagement using content.</p>



<p>Content can take any form. Videos, Audio, Images, Articles, you name it.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a great way to showcase a business or brand as an industry expert. </p>



<p>Like I always tell my clients, don&#8217;t try selling the business, sell your thoughts and ideas.</p>

<h3>Email Marketing</h3>



<p>Email marketing isn&#8217;t dead, not just yet.</p>



<p>In fact, it is still the number one choice for most businesses looking to improve sales using sales funnels.</p>



<p>So what really is email marketing?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="853" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/email-marketing.jpeg" alt="Email Marketing" class="wp-image-206" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/email-marketing.jpeg 1280w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/email-marketing-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/email-marketing-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/email-marketing-768x512.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><figcaption>Email Marketing &#8211; Photo by rawpixel.com from Pexels</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to Wikipedia, <em>email marketing is the act of sending commercial messages, typically to a group of people, using email</em>.</p>



<p>The term <em>commercial</em> is very key to the definition of email marketing.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve always considered email marketing as the endpoint of any online marketing strategy.</p>



<p>Meaning, all online marketing campaign should encourage some form of lead generation for the business.</p>



<p>But be careful while running email marketing campaigns, it&#8217;s a bit more personal than you think.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t use an email list sold online or given to you by a friend, you are going to loose money and time.</p>



<p>Focus on growing your own email subscription list using tools like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MailChimp (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mailchimp.com" target="_blank">MailChimp</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="HelloBar (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.hellobar.com/" target="_blank">HelloBar</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="OptinMonster (opens in a new tab)" href="https://optinmonster.com/" target="_blank">OptinMonster</a>.</p>



<p>You will definitely have a better <a href="http://clickmedia.com.ng/5-inexpensive-ways-to-improve-website-conversion-rate-in-2019/">conversion rate.</a></p>



<p>Growing your own list of email subscribers can be slow and agonising, but, it&#8217;s better to send out 50 emails with a 40% conversion rate than 5,000 emails with 0% conversion.</p>



<p>To understand more about email marketing and how to design successful email campaigns,<a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" read this great article I found on hubspot.

<p>In conclusion, online marketing is a great skill to have.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-173" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-business-banner.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="416" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-business-banner.jpg 740w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-business-banner-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /></p>
<p>WhatsApp Business app is another revolutionary tool for small, medium and large scale business owner to engage with their customers effectively.</p>
<p>Are you operating a business and find it hard keeping up with enquires coming in from the various social media networks you are signed up with?</p>
<p>This is a common problem most small and medium-sized business owners face on a daily basis, but not to worry, I can propose another solution.</p>
<p>WhatsApp launched <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatsApp Business</a> early 2018 as a communication tool to help business owners engage better with their customers.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what WhatsApp is, I&#8217;m sorry but it seems you&#8217;re not from around here, just kidding.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/258749/most-popular-global-mobile-messenger-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Statista</a> in their October 2018 <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/258749/most-popular-global-mobile-messenger-apps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most popular mobile messaging app worldwide</a> based on active monthly usage, WhatsApp was ranked number 1 with over 1.5bn active monthly users with Facebook following closely behind at 1.3bn monthly active users.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_168" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-168" style="width: 740px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-168 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/statista-mobile-messenger-application-usage.jpg" alt="Mobile messenger active monthly users by Statista" width="740" height="485" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/statista-mobile-messenger-application-usage.jpg 740w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/statista-mobile-messenger-application-usage-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-168" class="wp-caption-text">Mobile messenger active monthly users by Statista</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>We all use WhatsApp to communicate on a daily basis with families, friends, colleagues, co-workers, clients, the list is endless.</p>
<p>Basically, anyone with a smartphone and internet can chat with anyone from the other side of the world.</p>
<p>You can send pictures, videos, make audio and video calls, even with someone in Space (as far as there are smartphones with internet connections).</p>
<p>With the world approaching a population of around 7bn people and growing annually, WhatsApp active users account for 21.42% of that population.</p>
<h4><em>Still not impressed?</em></h4>
<p><a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatsApp Business</a> app was launched exactly a year ago and already has over <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp.w4b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 million downloads on the Google Play store</a> as at January 2019.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_174" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174" style="width: 740px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-174" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-business-download-statistics.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="416" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-business-download-statistics.jpg 740w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-business-download-statistics-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-174" class="wp-caption-text">Over 10 million downloads as at January 2019</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>This means many businesses like yours have adopted the new <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatsApp Business</a> app as their preferred messaging app with their customers.</p>
<h4><em>So what are you waiting for?</em></h4>
<p>In this article, I will be showing you all you need to get started with <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatsApp Business</a> to help you increase engagement and ultimately, sales.</p>
<p>But first, let me show you some of the amazingly cool features of the WhatsApp Business app.</p>
<h3>Business Profile</h3>
<p>Yes, you heard it. With the <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatsApp Business</a> app, you can set up a business profile else it wouldn&#8217;t be a business app, right?</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_173" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-173" style="width: 740px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-173" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-business-banner.jpg" alt="WhatsApp Business profile set up screen" width="740" height="416" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-business-banner.jpg 740w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-business-banner-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-173" class="wp-caption-text">WhatsApp Business profile set up screen</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The great thing is you can set up your business name, give a brief description of your business, opening hours, business address, website link etc.</p>
<p>The setup is very straightforward and most of you shouldn&#8217;t have a problem with it.</p>
<h3>Labels</h3>
<p>Labels are a great way to organize your contact and messages so you can easily keep track of them.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_171" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-171" style="width: 740px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-171" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-business-app-label-set-up.jpg" alt="WhatsApp Business Label set up" width="740" height="416" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-business-app-label-set-up.jpg 740w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-business-app-label-set-up-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-171" class="wp-caption-text">WhatsApp Business Label set up</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>You can create as many labels as you want like purchases, pending payments, new orders or leads, just about anything you can think of.</p>
<p>Labels are colour coded so it is easy to identify what each label stands for.[cm-trigger-newsletter]</p>
<h3>Quick Replies</h3>
<p>Quick replies are a really cool feature on the <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatsApp Business</a> App.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_172" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172" style="width: 740px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-172 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-business-app-quick-replies-set-up.jpg" alt="WhatsApp Business quick replies set up" width="740" height="416" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-business-app-quick-replies-set-up.jpg 740w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-business-app-quick-replies-set-up-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-172" class="wp-caption-text">WhatsApp Business quick replies set up</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>They are a great way to store snippets of reusable messages for quick replies.</p>
<p>A good example will be <strong>&#8220;Thank you for your order, you will be notified once your product has been shipped&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p>Imagine having to type that every single time you make a sale, exhausting isn&#8217;t it.</p>
<p>Quick replies are very easy to set up and access on the app.</p>
<p>I encourage you to set up as many quick replies as possible cos it will save you a lot of time and money.</p>
<h3>Automated Messages</h3>
<p>Imagine being away from your phone and a customer sends you a message.</p>
<p>Or, you&#8217;re in transit without access to the internet and a message comes in from a customer.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_170" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170" style="width: 740px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-170" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-business-app-away-message.jpg" alt="WhatsApp Business automated message" width="740" height="416" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-business-app-away-message.jpg 740w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-business-app-away-message-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-170" class="wp-caption-text">WhatsApp Business automated message</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Automated messages help you predefine a special message that will be sent to your customer when you don&#8217;t have access to your phone.</p>
<p>You can also create a greeting message to introduce your customer to your product.</p>
<p>We all know that a quick response to a customers enquiry and greatly improve your chances of landing a sale.</p>
<p>This feature is actually my favourite, it is similar to a phone voicemail set up that allows you to leave a message while away from your phone.</p>
<h3>Messaging Statistics</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatsApp Business</a> app gives you a great way to track your messages.</p>
<p>Imagine being able to track how many messages you have sent, how many messages were successfully delivered and how many messages were read, how cool is that?</p>
<p>It is such a great way to get an overview of how well you are communicating with your customers.</p>
<h3>What you need to get started</h3>
<p>The obvious answer is an Android smartphone, internet access and a dedicated phone number for your business.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed, <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/business" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WhatsApp Business</a> is only available officially on the Android platform as at the time of writing.</p>
<p>If you have a dual sim Android smartphone, you&#8217;re in luck.</p>
<p>The WhatsApp and WhatsApp Business app are two different applications so you can run simultaneously on your dual sim smartphone.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_169" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-169" style="width: 740px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-169" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-and-whatsapp-business-app.jpg" alt="WhatsApp and WhatsApp Business app on an android phone" width="740" height="278" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-and-whatsapp-business-app.jpg 740w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/whatsapp-and-whatsapp-business-app-300x113.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-169" class="wp-caption-text">WhatsApp and WhatsApp Business app on an android phone</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>If you are already using WhatsApp on your business line, you can still download WhatsApp Business and move your profile.</p>
<p>As you can see, I said: <strong>&#8220;move&#8221; </strong>and not <em>register</em>.</p>
<p>This is the only available option WhatsApp Business gives to you as you can only register one phone number per WhatsApp application.</p>
<p>Once you have WhatsApp Business installed on your smartphone, you are now ready to take advantage of all the productive features.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have a dual sim phone, you might consider buying a dedicated smartphone for your business.</p>
<p>Trust me, you will not regret it.</p>
<h3>Where can I download WhatsApp Business app?</h3>
<p>To download the WhatsApp Business app, visit the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp.w4b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play store</a> and search for WhatsApp Business.</p>
<p>If you are like me, very impatient, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.whatsapp.w4b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just click here and that should lead you to the Google Play store</a>.</p>
<p>Once the app has been downloaded and installed, it is time to set it up.</p>
<h3>How to set up WhatsApp Business?</h3>
<p>If you already have a business line that is set up for WhatsApp, make sure you backup your chats to Google Drive so you don&#8217;t lose them.</p>
<p>To back up your chats, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Chats</strong> &gt; <strong>Chat backup</strong> and click on <strong>Back up.</strong></p>
<p>This should backup your chats to Google Drive.</p>
<h4>Step 1 &#8211; Phone number set up</h4>
<p>If your phone number was previously registered on WhatsApp, you will be prompted to move your profile.</p>
<p>You will be required to verify your phone number using a verification code sent via SMS to your phone.</p>
<p>If your phone number has never been registered on WhatsApp, you can register and verify your phone number.</p>
<h4>Step 2 &#8211; Business profile set up</h4>
<p>Once all the verifications have taken place, you can then set up your business profile.</p>
<p>This also is very straightforward, just provide your business name, choose a category and enter a brief description.</p>
<p>If you have a website, you can provide it in the available box. If not, just enter your Facebook, Instagram or Twitter link.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can leave it blank but I&#8217;d advice you use any of the social media platforms you use in promoting your business.</p>
<p>You can also set up your business opening hours and address if you want to provide that information.</p>
<p>To edit your business profile settings at any time, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Business settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Profile.</strong></p>
<h4>Step 3 &#8211; Automated Messages</h4>
<p>I highly recommend setting up an automated response.</p>
<p>This is especially useful when you are without your phone or out of network coverage.</p>
<p>WhatsApp Business provides you with a default message but it might not be what you want to tell your customers.</p>
<p>To set up your automated message, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong> Business settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Away message.</strong></p>
<p>You can also set up your greeting message and quick replies while you are at it.</p>
<p>The greeting message is very useful when customers contact you for the first time or after 14 days of inactivity.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a quick way to respond to customer assuming you are busy.</p>
<p>Your greeting message can simply be a quick introduction to your business or any message to keep them engaged.</p>
<p>To set up your greeting message, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong> Business settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Greeting message.</strong></p>
<h4>Step 4 &#8211; Quick Replies</h4>
<p>As I mentioned above, quick replies can save you a lot of time and money.</p>
<p>My advice to you is to write down a few snippets of text that might come in handy.</p>
<p>These can be simple thank you messages or a list of services or products you offer.</p>
<p>Trust me, it will come in handy as your contact list grows.</p>
<p>To set up your greeting message, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;<strong> Business settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Quick replies.</strong></p>
<p>To use quick replies in your message, simply start your message with a forward slash (/) and all your saved quick replies will pop up.</p>
<p>As you already can tell, the convenience of chatting with your customers on the go can greatly improve your sales.</p>
<p>I encourage you to use WhatsApp Business if you currently run a business.</p>
<p>Chances are that your potential customers already use WhatsApp to communicate, just make it easy for them and watch your sales skyrocket.</p>

<p>I know what you&#8217;re thinking, why Lagos Nigeria? why not some other state, country or the world as a whole.</p>
<p>The simple answer to that is, you have to start someone at least. I choose Lagos simply because we are a <a href="http://clickmedia.com.ng/web-design-company-in-lagos-nigeria/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website design and development agency</a> currently based in Lagos and Lagos state Nigeria has the highest number of small, medium and large businesses than anywhere else in Nigeria.</p>
<p>If you are looking to start a career as a professional website designer/developer, your initial website projects will be based on businesses within your locality so be sure you put that into consideration.</p>
<p>Before we get started, let us draw a distinction between <strong>Website Design</strong> and <strong>Website Development</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Website Design</strong></h3>
<p>This relates to visual aspects of websites or web pages, this is what people see and interact with when they visit any website. It involves the use of colours, layout structure, graphics to create a harmonic balance amongst the elements that make up a website.</p>
<h3><strong>Website Development</strong></h3>
<p>This, on the other hand, website development involves the logic that runs on the server to fetch and process records mostly stored in a database for presentation to the end user, which in this case, the website designer.</p>
<p>As you can see, a website designer plays an important role in a website creation cycle. They are responsible for how a website looks and feels, how people interact with it and what kind of emotion it evokes in people.</p>
<h3>What you need to learn to become a professional website designer</h3>
<p><figure id="attachment_152" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-152" style="width: 1280px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-152" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/how-to-become-a-website-designer-in-lagos-nigeria.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="631" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/how-to-become-a-website-designer-in-lagos-nigeria.jpg 1280w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/how-to-become-a-website-designer-in-lagos-nigeria-300x148.jpg 300w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/how-to-become-a-website-designer-in-lagos-nigeria-1024x505.jpg 1024w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/how-to-become-a-website-designer-in-lagos-nigeria-768x379.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-152" class="wp-caption-text">Image source: pexels.com</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard people say you don&#8217;t need to learn how to code to become a good website designer, while this might be true to some extent, it is not 100% correct.</p>
<p>If you start learning website design by using tools like <a href="http://wix.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wix</a> and other do-it-yourself websites tool, you will become dependent on those tools without knowing how to make minor style changes.</p>
<p>To get started as a website designer here is what you need to learn</p>
<h3>HTML</h3>
<p>HTML or Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for creating website pages and web applications. It&#8217;s a very easy language to learn and you will be up and running in no time. Here are some few resources to help you get started with HTML</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">w3schools</a></li>
<li><a href="https://html.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">html.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mozilla Development Network (MDN)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codecademy</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>CSS</h3>
<p>CSS or Cascading Style Sheet is a language that describes the style an HTML document should take. This includes everything from colours to font size, layout structure and much more. Like HTML, it is fairly easy to learn and get up and running with. Here are a few great resources to help you get started with CSS</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Css/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">w3schools</a></li>
<li><a href="https://css-tricks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSS Tricks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.csstutorial.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSS Tutorials</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mozilla Development Network (MDN)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>JavaScript (Not Java)</h3>
<p>Unlike HTML &amp; CSS which are essential to learning website design, JavaScript, on the other hand, isn&#8217;t. JavaScript is the scripting language of the web. It&#8217;s used to create responsive user interaction and interfaces on web pages. You can build websites without needing a single line of JavaScript but if you&#8217;re aiming to become a <strong>professional website designer</strong>, you need to learn a little bit of JavaScript. Although it&#8217;s more difficult to learn than HTML &amp; CSS combined, a little knowledge of JavaScript can be quite rewarding and adds the icing on the cake with your finished website design project. Here are some resources to help you get started with JavaScript</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.javascript.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JavaScript</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/Js/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">w3schools</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Codecademy</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TutorialsPoint</a></li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mozilla Development Network (MDN)</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Final notes</h3>
<p>Website designer as the name suggests are designers. They understand colour balance, layout, typography and how a fusion of all these elements creates a beautiful masterpiece. Don&#8217;t be scared if you don&#8217;t understand design as a whole, you can start learning by <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=how+to+design+for+the+web&amp;atb=v109-1&amp;ia=web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reading some design resources online</a> and getting inspired by <a href="http://collectui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other peoples work</a>. When you are able to combine website and design, what you end up with is <strong>ART</strong>. if you have any questions, please leave them in the comment section below.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we gear up for the new year with heightened expectations and projections, it&#8217;s worth remembering that your website, for most businesses and brand is the first line of contact between you and your customers. Improving your website conversion rate can greatly increase sales and revenue with little or no effort, you only need to understand how your visitors use your website and optimize accordingly.</p>
<p>In this article, I&#8217;m going to show you 5 inexpensive ways to improve your website conversion rate using only a handful of free online tools and techniques to help you make the most out of your website in 2019 but first, let&#8217;s define what a website conversion rate is and how to calculate it.</p>
<h3>What is a Website Conversion Rate?</h3>
<p>A website or landing page conversion rate is the percentage of people who perform an expected action on your website versus the total number of visitors.</p>
<p>The formula can be written like this: <strong>(# of visitors who completed an action) / (total # of visitors) * 100</strong>.</p>
<p>This percentage can be anywhere from 1% to as much as 15% or even higher. It&#8217;s not unusual to see some websites or landing page performing better than others based on their set KPI&#8217;s, but keeping an eye on your conversion rate can help you optimize your website to constantly improve your website conversion rate.</p>
<p>Before we get started, it&#8217;s important that you first define your website&#8217;s key performance index (KPI). We&#8217;ve had clients walk up to us with a website design request without defining their KPI, so if you&#8217;re also struggling to find the right KPI for your website, here are a few to consider.</p>
<ul>
<li>Newsletter Signup</li>
<li>Downloading a free resource like an EBook, trial software, music tracks etc.</li>
<li>Filling out a contact form</li>
<li>Buying a product</li>
<li>Reading an article</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever you consider as your website&#8217;s key performance index, be sure to clearly state it out at the very beginning so it can properly be optimized for. With that out of the way, let&#8217;s get to the business of the day and show you how to improve your website conversion rate.</p>
<h3>#1 Improve Design and Visual Appeal</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s a no-brainer that beautifully designed websites or landing pages perform better than their poorly designed counterparts. Even if you don&#8217;t have an eye for design, a quick 5-minute research to see what your competitor&#8217;s website or landing page looks like can ignite your creativity.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-163" style="width: 800px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-163 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/houses-ui-large-1.jpeg" alt="" width="800" height="600" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/houses-ui-large-1.jpeg 800w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/houses-ui-large-1-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/houses-ui-large-1-768x576.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-163" class="wp-caption-text">Source: collectui.com by Vladimir Biondic</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Use contrasting colours to emphasize important sections of your website like special offers, call-to-action buttons and newsletter signup forms.  Conversions depend on many factors, but the actual appearance of your site and the feeling it gives people has a lot to do with whether or not they take action. Something as simple as using contrasting colours can make a big difference in the long run.</p>
<h3>#2 Create Landing Pages</h3>
<p>Landing pages are a great way to improve website conversion rate. It&#8217;s a page on your website with content that addresses one specific area of your business, service or product. It should include a single call to action. Its entire purpose is to capture your visitor&#8217;s contact information or make a sale.</p>
<p>A specific landing page and call to action is more relevant to the visitor’s needs than your homepage and is more likely to convert.</p>
<h3>#3 Use Clear Call To Action</h3>
<p>A clear call to action (CTA) is a good way to have your visitors take immediate action on your website. Whether you want them to watch a video, download or try a product for free or signup for your newsletter, using clear and concise call-to-action buttons with contrasting colours can greatly improve your conversion rate.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_164" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-164" style="width: 1369px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-164 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/moz-landing-page-1.png" alt="" width="1369" height="956" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/moz-landing-page-1.png 1369w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/moz-landing-page-1-300x209.png 300w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/moz-landing-page-1-1024x715.png 1024w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/moz-landing-page-1-768x536.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1369px) 100vw, 1369px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-164" class="wp-caption-text">MOZ.com landing page</figcaption></figure></p>
<p>You can see an example of using high-contrast colours found on Moz.com landing page. If you are having trouble figuring out how to mix and match colours, a good online tool is <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/?base=2&amp;rule=Triad&amp;selected=0&amp;name=My%20Color%20Theme&amp;mode=rgb&amp;rgbvalues=0.7,0.06999999999999998,0.06999999999999998,1,0.9879032258064626,0.09999999999999998,1,0,0,0.07999999999999999,0.5221052631580096,0.8,0.03500000000000003,0.44333333333343944,0.7&amp;swatchOrder=0,1,2,3,4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adobe Kuler Color Wheel.</a></p>
<h3>#4 Use Simple Forms</h3>
<p>Using simple forms with fewer fields cannot be overemphasized. Every field you ask visitors to fill increases friction and the likelihood of them not converting. In most cases, you don&#8217;t need to ask for anything but their email address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-161 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/forms-collection-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/forms-collection-1.jpg 1024w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/forms-collection-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/forms-collection-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>In one study, an 11 field contact form was replaced by a 4 field version resulting in a 160% increase in form submission and a 120% increase in conversion.</p>
<p>Keep your forms simple, more often than not, what you need from your visitors to make a sale, promote your service or engage with your brand is their email address, nothing more.</p>
<h3>#5 Track, Analyse and Optimize</h3>
<p>Using <a href="https://google.com/analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics</a> and <a href="https://facebook.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook Pixels Tracking</a>, you can monitor traffic in and out of your website and optimize pages with high traffic to increase conversion.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-162 size-full" src="http://localhost:8888/2021/clickmedia/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-analytic-report-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-analytic-report-1.jpg 1024w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-analytic-report-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://clickmedia.com.ng/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/google-analytic-report-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you have an article that generates a considerable amount of traffic, you can optimize the article by any of the following;</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding a lead generation form</li>
<li>Email subscription form</li>
<li>Introducing links to other landing pages or relevant content</li>
<li>Promote an offer to increase conversion</li>
</ul>
<p>There are lots of options to consider when optimizing high-performing pages on your website, being able to identify those pages can result in higher conversion rate when optimized properly.</p>
